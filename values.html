    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold header-color mb-4">Our Values and Standards</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">At Revalen, our values are not aspirational — they are operational. They guide our decision-making, shape our partnerships, and define how we conduct ourselves.</p>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <section class="mt-12 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold header-color mb-4">Our Purpose</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Values are often spoken of as ethical signposts - important, but separate from the core mechanics of business. At Revalen, we see them differently. Our values are the mechanics; the blueprint for how enduring societal and financial value is created.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">When we focus on progress that serves people, advances technology with purpose, and respects the environment within which we operate, we build enterprises that matter - ones that communities want, talent seeks out, and capital sustains. Financial return, in this model, isn’t the aim. It’s the outcome. A natural consequence of contribution, relevance, and trust.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">These principles are not aspirational statements. They are operating standards - practical, intentional, and embedded in every decision we make. We fiercely reject the stale logic of shareholder-first thinking, cost-cutting without context, or growth at the expense of safety, integrity, or innovation. These approaches may be conventional, but they are no longer credible.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We expect those we work with - partners, subcontractors, collaborators - to respect this approach. At a minimum, they must allow Revalen and its people to uphold these values without compromise. Ideally, they’ll go further, embracing these values and integrating the same standards into their own work.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Holding to these values will often mean standing apart. It will take resolve to push back on deeply embedded norms, and creativity to develop solutions that honour both principle and performance. But we firmly believe that this is the only path worth taking. It’s the only path that produces not just short-term wins, but long-term impact, financial abundance and non-material wealth.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This document sets out the values and standards that define how Revalen operates, and what we expect from those we engage with - whether in joint ventures, client partnerships, delivery networks, or investment relationships. These principles are intended to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>Define the mindset, behaviour, and shared responsibility expected from everyone involved—guiding how we think, decide, and act, especially when the way forward isn’t obvious.</li>
        <li>Shape clear choices about the projects, partnerships, and directions we commit to, or consciously avoid.</li>
        <li>Help us stay oriented toward building a safe, profitable, and sustainable future, not through perfection, but through consistent course correction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We move forward with those who see value in this, not just as a principle, but as a practical, proven way to build something enduring.</p>
